    It is important to note that admission of students to the FYP and FBSU will be usually in the first semester, and possibly in the second semester. Each student is required to take placement tests in English, IT, and Mathematics to determine their level in these topics. Students will be placed in one of two levels in English, IT, and Mathematics based on their performance on the corresponding placement tests. The duration of each level is one semester with 15 weeks followed by properly designed proficiency tests. The tests are designed by the FYP faculty members in consultation with the AUB team specifically for this purpose.  In addition, where applicable, students must satisfy the admission criteria set by the colleges to which they apply.
Students joining the FYP will be placed in one of two levels in English, IT, and Mathematics based on their performance on the corresponding placement tests. The duration of each level is one semester with 15 weeks followed by properly designed proficiency tests.
The program could be completed in one or two semesters depending on the entry level of the learner as well as on the skills and content targets as determined by the proficiency tests. It is important, therefore, that all stakeholders realize that it takes time to acquire, reinforce, and build on literacy and content skills. Students who fail to complete the program in two years may be asked to withdraw from the University.<br>

    <h3><strong>English Courses</strong></h3>
<p>ENG 100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundation Year English 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This 15-week Intensive English Program aims at developing students’ ability to understand and use English confidently by improving their four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing). The program provides students with language skills, functions, and structures that are essential for successful communication in both speaking and writing. It is also meant to prepare students to pursue specialized courses taught through the medium of English. The program also provides instruction pertaining to the fundamentals of language skills, including reading, composition, and listening skills; grammar; and study skills.</p>
<p>To these ends, the course is divided into four modules:&nbsp;<strong>Listening &amp; Speaking, Reading, Grammar and Writing</strong>. Students study in class/lab 18 contact hours weekly.</p>

<p>ENG 200&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundation Year English 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This multi-skill intermediate course is a continuation of the first level English course (ENG100) in the sense that it aims at further consolidation of the four language skills through more sophisticated language texts and structures, with also a special focus on writing. The course requires a review and practice of the basic grammar, writing and reading skills needed for a college level writing course, and the study of rhetorical structures as applied to effective writing communication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To these ends, the course is divided into four modules:&nbsp;<strong>Listening &amp; Speaking, Reading, Grammar and Writing</strong>. Students study in class/lab 18 contact hours weekly.</p>
